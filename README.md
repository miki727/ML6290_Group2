#### - Workflow

Among Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Monotonic Gradient Boosting (MXGB), and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) models, the highest area under curve (AUC) belonged to for EBM model with a value of 0.8249. Therefore, we chosed EBM model as the best model. Bias testing was done by spliting the different groups like "black", "asian", "white", "male", and "female" and calculating the adverse impact ratio (AIR) and area under the curve (AUC). Model extraction attack was done via red-teaming. Lastly, sensitivity analysis (stress testing), residual analysis, and remediation (removing outliers and down-sampling to increase signal from high-priced loans) were done to ensure model debugging.

#### - Intended use

* **Primary intended uses**
  * Intended to be used for banks/ financial institutions to decide whether to lend money to mortgage applicants based on their personal background such as their income, race, gender, etc.


* **Primary intended users**
  * Particularly intended for those mortgage applicants who are planning to invest in real estate.


* **Out-of-scope use cases**
  * The model can only be used to those who ask to a financial assistance in state-owned enterprise public companies rather than provided to all kinds of institutions because of the model limitations and small institutions' data collection capabilities.

#### - Quantitative analysis 

* **Model selection:** Our criteria is AUC and the higher AUC means the better model. Based on the following value, we choose EBM model as the best model.

  | Model | AUC    |
  | ----- | ------ |
  | GLM   | 0.7538 |
  | MXGB  | 0.7921 |
  | EBM   | 0.8249 |

* **Feature importanceï¼š**The best EBM feature importance plot shows global importance in EBM to make a feature selection.

* **Partial dependence:** Every feature in each plot in the following are partially effect predicted variable high_priced in EBM.

* **Remediation of Discovered Discrimination:** 

  * **Grid search results as plot:** According to grid search results, the remediated EBM retrained with the best AUC is 0.7878 above 0.8 AIR (0.8002), and we can get the hyperparameters.

  * Adversarial examples that can reliably evoke extremely low and high enough predictions from the blackbox API (0.38 is likely above the cutoff for most credit models). These can most easily be used to falsify a loan application to recieve a low-priced loan (using low adversaries). Or they could be used to ensure someone else recievces a high-priced loan.

#### - Ethical considerations

* Different criterias chosen for building the same models may cause varied results. The biased results will cause harm to people in the real world. The data used should be kept secure and extremely confidential since any illegitimate use will cause severe privacy concerns. The model will most likely start going in the wrong direction if it is not constantly maintained and managed. Everyone working on this kind of sensitive data should not poison the data for their personal ulterior motives which might be detrimental to others.

#### - Caveats and Recommendations

* The training data is unbalanced, which may cause some unbalanced results in different groups during evaluation.
